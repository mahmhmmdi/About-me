## About Me:

I'm Mahsa, born in the lush heart of northern Iran in the midst of spring, which instilled in me a deep love for nature.

Currently, I'm a second-year PhD student in the Complex Biosystems program. Since my advisor is affiliated with the Biological Engineering department, I'm also a part of BSE.

My research focus involves creating innovative tools and theories for microbiome modeling, with the ultimate aim of becoming a computational biologist upon graduation.
